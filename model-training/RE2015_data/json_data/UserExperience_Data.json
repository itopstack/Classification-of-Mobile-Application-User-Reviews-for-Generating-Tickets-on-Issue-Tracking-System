This killed my internet as it is a very big game that takes half an hour to install - if you don't like the game, their is no chance of a refund. Once I finally got the proper game, it is very pretty with smooth graphics, an amazing sound track, and some of the best scenery I've ever seen on my tablet. In the next update, I want to be seeing the right installment first time, a chance of a refund, and free roam! Free roam was the best part of the old games, I would love to have it on my tablet!

If you are seeking for an app mainly to write school paper, do basic spreadsheet, and reading PDF articles, this is the one.  Of course, you can't compare to iWork apps because they will definitely beat this app in terms of looks and quality (called great marketing).  But if you are a poor student like me, paying student loans, and are seeking for an app mainly to write papers and read docs, I recommend with this one. I have not tried the PowerPoint yet, so I can't say much about it.",

        "comment": "///Update///\n\n149 rounds recorded. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% left after rounds. Still no side game tracking but the notes feature works somewhat for that. Finally fivesomes! Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!\n\n17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). I'm confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as I'm walking up to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time I'm standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.\n\nOnce we get side games/betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app!   \n////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nUsed Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! It's accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didn't know I wanted, but now I can't live without!\n\nEnded up being cheaper to buy a new iPhone 3GS AND this app than the skycaddie I was looking at. Stand alone golf GPS units are in serious trouble.",

        "comment": "This is a great app. I've used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2. Each version is more refined. I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version (currently 'The Message') when I tap on the Scripture for the day. This isn't the case with the iPhone app. One always has to change the version from the default.\n\nThere are a couple formatting issue suggestions:\n\n1. The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website. It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row.\n2. One of the things I've always enjoyed are the cover photos. The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner, but there is no way to enlarge it. One would think that a simple double-tap could bring up the cover art full screen?\n3. When traveling I don't always have a wifi link, so having issues cached is nice. In those instances I simply use my Bible app (or print version) to get the Scripture for the day. I don't expect (or want) ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway.com on my device, but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set-up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day. May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app.\n\nKeep up the good work!",

There is an option to add it to your calendar and it puts all the information right in your phone calendar. You can invite your co-diners easily through the app (it creates an email for you). A great part is that you can filter your search by 1000 point tables only, by neighborhoods within a city, by distance to you, and so much more. I use this app on a regular basis- so much that I'll make a reservation we just decided to go to so that it's easier when we get there! It's such a great app (and business) that I always wonder why some restaurants don't have it!",
