First the pros: the interface is intuitive and easy to use, the self-timer is fully adjustable (rather than just having a 2 and 10 second option for example), and the editing options are also easy to use. However, I will not be using the app because of the lack of manual cropping. The crop menu gives several size options, you choose one, and the app....automatically crops your picture. Do you see where this is going wrong? I suppose if your pictures were always perfectly centered and you just wanted to get the correct dimensions, this would work. Me, I don't always have my perfectly composed shot. I use my phone to take many pictures of my (moving) children, and often I have a lot of space on one side that needs to be cropped out to make a good shot. A camera app that automatically crops in the center and doesn't give me the option to at least adjust the cropping is absolutely useless to me, and a complete waste of the money I paid for it. I looked all over for this feature, thinking they can't POSSIBLY have neglected such a basic function, but it is glaringly missing.",
