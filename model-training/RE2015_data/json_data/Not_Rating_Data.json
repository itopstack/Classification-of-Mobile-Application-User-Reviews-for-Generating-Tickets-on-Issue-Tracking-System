Here's my update - the app has not been refunded yet.   I tried again to use it and it crashes when accessing Google drive.   It also crashes half the time opening my power point and has no editing features when it does open.   This app would be terrible were it free.   For a high price it's ridiculous",

First the pros: the interface is intuitive and easy to use, the self-timer is fully adjustable (rather than just having a 2 and 10 second option for example), and the editing options are also easy to use. However, I will not be using the app because of the lack of manual cropping. The crop menu gives several size options, you choose one, and the app....automatically crops your picture. Do you see where this is going wrong? I suppose if your pictures were always perfectly centered and you just wanted to get the correct dimensions, this would work. Me, I don't always have my perfectly composed shot. I use my phone to take many pictures of my (moving) children, and often I have a lot of space on one side that needs to be cropped out to make a good shot. A camera app that automatically crops in the center and doesn't give me the option to at least adjust the cropping is absolutely useless to me, and a complete waste of the money I paid for it. I looked all over for this feature, thinking they can't POSSIBLY have neglected such a basic function, but it is glaringly missing.",

        "comment": "I just tested this app out so that I could view Horrible Bosses as an UltraViolet Digital Copy, and I noticed that the movie was hard to see in some places because of what looked like really bad blurry areas right after the logos. This happened throughout the movie. This never happened to me with the regular digital copies that were compatible with iTunes. I could see everything clearly when I was using the regular digital copies. I think that if I have to buy these combo packs with UltraViolet Digital Copy, I will never use this app again. I'll stick to the UltraViolet/Flixster cloud because there it wasn't blurry at all. On top of this, since the update ALL the UltraViolet movies are buffering and skipping. This never happened with my last update. Please fix.",

So many things\n\nAutomatic photovideo upload, iPhoto import, works with the Mailbox app, shared folders, photo aggregation on the website and mobile, the ability to store files only on the cloud (saves space on my Mac from old files)\n\nand the obvious things like having everything backed up in real-time, and accessibility of my files from anywhere\n\nI could do without it anymore! Remember when we just had computers and hoped they didn&#39t break and lose all our files?\n\nOne suggestion if I have automatic photo upload on and download a photo to my phone&#39s camera roll (say, for #TBT), don&#39t automatically re-upload it to Camera Imports! It&#39s already in Dropbox, silly And yes, obviously if I use Instagram or some other photo sharing software to doctor it, I know it&#39s a different photo and will therefore upload",
