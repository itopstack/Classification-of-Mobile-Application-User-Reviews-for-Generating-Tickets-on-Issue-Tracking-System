This killed my internet as it is a very big game that takes half an hour to install - if you don't like the game, their is no chance of a refund. Once I finally got the proper game, it is very pretty with smooth graphics, an amazing sound track, and some of the best scenery I've ever seen on my tablet. In the next update, I want to be seeing the right installment first time, a chance of a refund, and free roam! Free roam was the best part of the old games, I would love to have it on my tablet!

All other maps and features worked fine. I emailed customer support that night around 11pm., and had a response and a solution via email when I checked mail at 9 am, Christmas morning! Now, that's what I would consider excellent support. Seems there was a small issue  with Google terrain maps that only affected purchases on Friday the 23rd, and Saturday the 24th.

Please fix.   The \"GROUP by PODCAST\" button is now dead after creating ONE playlist successfully....  I have uninstalled, reinstalled, rebooted my iphone, etc.\nPlease help... an AWESOME program otherwise.   I just have a lot of podcasts and need to be able to group them... the iPhone's hard installed video app does that for me ... but I really want to use your program vs. the iPhones app....\nPlease advise.",

There's not a lot of detail in the information, particularly in details for upcoming days.

Nevertheless, this isn't meant to be too detailed, and it provides plenty of info for the current time. My biggest complaint is that the app crashes on startup often. Sometimes it will load the second time, sometimes it requires a restart of my iPad 3rd generation. It's a nice looking app, the kind that you would want to have on your iPad, it just has a stability problem.",

        "title": "Really Bad Transfer",
        "comment": "I just tested this app out so that I could view Horrible Bosses as an UltraViolet Digital Copy, and I noticed that the movie was hard to see in some places because of what looked like really bad blurry areas right after the logos. This happened throughout the movie. This never happened to me with the regular digital copies that were compatible with iTunes. I could see everything clearly when I was using the regular digital copies. I think that if I have to buy these combo packs with UltraViolet Digital Copy, I will never use this app again. I'll stick to the UltraViolet/Flixster cloud because there it wasn't blurry at all. On top of this, since the update ALL the UltraViolet movies are buffering and skipping. This never happened with my last update. Please fix.",

There is an option to add it to your calendar and it puts all the information right in your phone calendar. You can invite your co-diners easily through the app (it creates an email for you). A great part is that you can filter your search by 1000 point tables only, by neighborhoods within a city, by distance to you, and so much more. I use this app on a regular basis- so much that I'll make a reservation we just decided to go to so that it's easier when we get there! It's such a great app (and business) that I always wonder why some restaurants don't have it!",

        "comment": "Out of a dozen attempts I made on my iPhone 4, I was able to get it to work three times. And even then it was frustratingly inconsistent in recognizing a pulse. I'm not sure what the indication is that it's reading your heart rate, as the \"dial\" moves around and then restarts constantly. Sometimes a blinking heart shows up. The instructions don't explain what the dial and heart icon are for. Keeping my finger in the same location would reveal a heart rate of 85... and then 31.\n\nWatched the video on their website to look at the location of my finger in comparison to theirs--same spot. It's possible that the technique they use to measure the heart rate doesn't work on everyone--thus the vast disparity in ratings for the app. Seems to work for some people and not for others.\n\nDoesn't work at all on my iPad 2 even in good lighting.",

Really? That's interesting, because I have location services blocked for Instagram and other photo apps and they work just fine.
