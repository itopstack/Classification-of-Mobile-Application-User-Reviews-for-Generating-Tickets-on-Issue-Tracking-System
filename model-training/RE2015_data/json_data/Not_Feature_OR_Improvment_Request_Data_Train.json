        "comment": "Out of a dozen attempts I made on my iPhone 4, I was able to get it to work three times. And even then it was frustratingly inconsistent in recognizing a pulse. I'm not sure what the indication is that it's reading your heart rate, as the \"dial\" moves around and then restarts constantly. Sometimes a blinking heart shows up. The instructions don't explain what the dial and heart icon are for. Keeping my finger in the same location would reveal a heart rate of 85... and then 31.\n\nWatched the video on their website to look at the location of my finger in comparison to theirs--same spot. It's possible that the technique they use to measure the heart rate doesn't work on everyone--thus the vast disparity in ratings for the app. Seems to work for some people and not for others.\n\nDoesn't work at all on my iPad 2 even in good lighting.",

        "comment": "I went in and made a playlist, I unselected the group podcasts button so it would go into my list of pod casts so that I could create playlists like NEWS, TECH, etc... it worked for the FIRST playlist created, now it won't work for any of the others I create, it will ONLY allow to select ALL the podcasts... very strange. Please fix.   The \"GROUP by PODCAST\" button is now dead after creating ONE playlist successfully....  I have uninstalled, reinstalled, rebooted my iphone, etc.\nPlease help... an AWESOME program otherwise.   I just have a lot of podcasts and need to be able to group them... the iPhone's hard installed video app does that for me ... but I really want to use your program vs. the iPhones app....\nPlease advise.",
