First the pros: the interface is intuitive and easy to use, the self-timer is fully adjustable (rather than just having a 2 and 10 second option for example), and the editing options are also easy to use. However, I will not be using the app because of the lack of manual cropping. The crop menu gives several size options, you choose one, and the app....automatically crops your picture. Do you see where this is going wrong? I suppose if your pictures were always perfectly centered and you just wanted to get the correct dimensions, this would work. Me, I don't always have my perfectly composed shot. I use my phone to take many pictures of my (moving) children, and often I have a lot of space on one side that needs to be cropped out to make a good shot. A camera app that automatically crops in the center and doesn't give me the option to at least adjust the cropping is absolutely useless to me, and a complete waste of the money I paid for it.

        "comment": "Slow performance hinders what is otherwise a great app\tI love the ABILITY to have spell check (extra small price for the feature).  But there are a few major downsides to this app that make it impractical:  It is so slow that when using a bluetooth keyboard, the keys do not register correctly (in the right sequence) and spaces get inserted in the middle of words.  Often I could type \"THE \" and would get \"TH E\".  I tested this over and over and even thought the keyboard might be the problem.  Then tested other Office Suite apps and found this was the ONLY one with this problem.   Second problem is that when using the cursor keys to navigate through a document, it often mistakenly thinks the cursor is at the end of a line and won't allow it to move any further.  This also causes a problem when trying to use the DEL key (deleting text from the right side of the cursor).  Since it often thinks the end of a line has been reached, it starts to delete text to the left of the cursor (like the Backspace key was being pressed) when in fact there is plenty of text remaining to the right.  This is the most feature-rich suite for sure.  Just needs speed improvements to be useful.",

The bad things about the last update? Now typing has lag which is very annoying. I don't see how that happened since there is no crazy graphical interface or anything animated. The major thing that is pretty much a deal breaker for most people is the removal of the TAB button. I always hated that the TAB button was up on the ruler. I would prefer having only one shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard. But now i wish it was back up top at least. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it.

Please fix.   The \"GROUP by PODCAST\" button is now dead after creating ONE playlist successfully....  I have uninstalled, reinstalled, rebooted my iphone, etc.\nPlease help... an AWESOME program otherwise.   I just have a lot of podcasts and need to be able to group them... the iPhone's hard installed video app does that for me ... but I really want to use your program vs. the iPhones app....\nPlease advise.",

Nevertheless, this isn't meant to be too detailed, and it provides plenty of info for the current time. My biggest complaint is that the app crashes on startup often.

        "comment": "Clear has one of the best-designed user interfaces I've ever encountered on the iPhone/iPad. It is the way apps should be. So simple and easy. I'm giving it 5 stars despite some shortcomings:\n\n1. It would be nice to sync with the desktop (iCal?) and between devices.\n2. It needs Reminders and Alerts (and Due Dates, etc.)\n3. Some kind of support for longer notes. Right now, single-tapping an item lets you edit the item. Maybe double-tapping should let you open an item's \"detail page\" where you could enter the due date, add an alarm, or type a longer note. \n4. Also, sharing a list? It would be great if my wife and I could add to or just see each other's shopping lists. Though now, I admit this is \"feature creep\" that could detract from Clear's simplicity.",

This happened throughout the movie. This never happened to me with the regular digital copies that were compatible with iTunes. I could see everything clearly when I was using the regular digital copies. I think that if I have to buy these combo packs with UltraViolet Digital Copy, I will never use this app again. I'll stick to the UltraViolet/Flixster cloud because there it wasn't blurry at all. On top of this, since the update ALL the UltraViolet movies are buffering and skipping. This never happened with my last update. Please fix.",

        "comment": "I'm giving the NFL '12 v3 update three stars largely because it's an improvement over the previous version. The in-game display is better organized, and the \"Scores\" page is vastly superior to the prior version: you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest amount of use, the app appears much more stable.\n\nHowever, it still needs work in many respects. The scoring summary is gone (so far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasn't following play-by-play. The \"team leaders\" appears limited to only 1 QB (passing), 1 player rushing, and 2 receivers, with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing. Especially during the preseason games, when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating--there's no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time. A more egregious problem is that (at least for the Thursday games in week 2), the teams do not switch properly: checking on the Atlanta vs. Cincinnati game, if I tap on the \"Atlanta Falcons\" button, I get the passing stats for A. Dalton; if i tap on the \"Cincinnati\" button I see the passing stats for M. Ryan (with the rushing and receiving stats for their teams). I'm hoping this is an operator error that will be fixed shortly, but it reflects poorly on the product. (I apologize for the comments length, I'm hoping that the NFL is monitoring this feedback.)",

I'm not sure what the indication is that it's reading your heart rate, as the \"dial\" moves around and then restarts constantly. Sometimes a blinking heart shows up. The instructions don't explain what the dial and heart icon are for. Keeping my finger in the same location would reveal a heart rate of 85... and then 31.\n\nWatched the video on their website to look at the location of my finger in comparison to theirs--same spot. It's possible that the technique they use to measure the heart rate doesn't work on everyone--thus the vast disparity in ratings for the app. Seems to work for some people and not for others.\n\nDoesn't work at all on my iPad 2 even in good lighting.",
