The result is a control system that is borderline unresponsive and makes fine movement or fast movement completely inefficient. This game is so tedious to play, it certainly isn't worth the hefty price tag associated with it. If you bought this during the sale; you got a great deal, but as someone who paid full price to support Team 17, I'm disappointed in this lackluster port. Overall the game is a great example of what can happen to a great idea when it's executed poorly. I am however, happy to give Team 17 a few extra dollars, and hope they make improvements over time.",

All other maps and features worked fine. I emailed customer support that night around 11pm., and had a response and a solution via email when I checked mail at 9 am, Christmas morning! Now, that's what I would consider excellent support. Seems there was a small issue  with Google terrain maps that only affected purchases on Friday the 23rd, and Saturday the 24th. I am all fixed up now and everything works great!",

If you are seeking for an app mainly to write school paper, do basic spreadsheet, and reading PDF articles, this is the one.  Of course, you can't compare to iWork apps because they will definitely beat this app in terms of looks and quality (called great marketing).  But if you are a poor student like me, paying student loans, and are seeking for an app mainly to write papers and read docs, I recommend with this one. I have not tried the PowerPoint yet, so I can't say much about it.",

Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!\n\n17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). I'm confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as I'm walking up to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time I'm standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.\n\nOnce we get side games/betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app!   \n////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nUsed Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! It's accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didn't know I wanted, but now I can't live without!\n\nEnded up being cheaper to buy a new iPhone 3GS AND this app than the skycaddie I was looking at.

The author even responded via email when I had a question. Link to full prescribing info is available when more technical info is needed. Especially useful for quick but thorough overviews of drugs are needed. Still very inexpensive when compared to other medical resources. Cheap enough to try it!",

        "title": "Great App Gets Better!",
        "comment": "This is a great app. I've used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2. Each version is more refined. I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version (currently 'The Message') when I tap on the Scripture for the day. This isn't the case with the iPhone app. One always has to change the version from the default.\n\nThere are a couple formatting issue suggestions:\n\n1. The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website. It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row.\n2. One of the things I've always enjoyed are the cover photos. The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner, but there is no way to enlarge it. One would think that a simple double-tap could bring up the cover art full screen?\n3. When traveling I don't always have a wifi link, so having issues cached is nice. In those instances I simply use my Bible app (or print version) to get the Scripture for the day. I don't expect (or want) ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway.com on my device, but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set-up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day. May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app.\n\nKeep up the good work!",

There's not a lot of detail in the information, particularly in details for upcoming days. The forecast is no more specific than a high and low temp and a picture representation of the weather for the entire day. Nevertheless, this isn't meant to be too detailed, and it provides plenty of info for the current time. My biggest complaint is that the app crashes on startup often. Sometimes it will load the second time, sometimes it requires a restart of my iPad 3rd generation. It's a nice looking app, the kind that you would want to have on your iPad, it just has a stability problem.",

I'm giving it 5 stars despite some shortcomings:\n\n1. It would be nice to sync with the desktop (iCal?) and between devices.\n2. It needs Reminders and Alerts (and Due Dates, etc.)\n3. Some kind of support for longer notes. Right now, single-tapping an item lets you edit the item. Maybe double-tapping should let you open an item's \"detail page\" where you could enter the due date, add an alarm, or type a longer note. \n4. Also, sharing a list? It would be great if my wife and I could add to or just see each other's shopping lists. Though now, I admit this is \"feature creep\" that could detract from Clear's simplicity.",

There is an option to add it to your calendar and it puts all the information right in your phone calendar. You can invite your co-diners easily through the app (it creates an email for you). A great part is that you can filter your search by 1000 point tables only, by neighborhoods within a city, by distance to you, and so much more. I use this app on a regular basis- so much that I'll make a reservation we just decided to go to so that it's easier when we get there! It's such a great app (and business) that I always wonder why some restaurants don't have it!",

        "title": "Better but still needs work",
        "comment": "I'm giving the NFL '12 v3 update three stars largely because it's an improvement over the previous version. The in-game display is better organized, and the \"Scores\" page is vastly superior to the prior version: you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest amount of use, the app appears much more stable.\n\nHowever, it still needs work in many respects. The scoring summary is gone (so far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasn't following play-by-play. The \"team leaders\" appears limited to only 1 QB (passing), 1 player rushing, and 2 receivers, with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing. Especially during the preseason games, when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating--there's no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time. A more egregious problem is that (at least for the Thursday games in week 2), the teams do not switch properly: checking on the Atlanta vs. Cincinnati game, if I tap on the \"Atlanta Falcons\" button, I get the passing stats for A. Dalton; if i tap on the \"Cincinnati\" button I see the passing stats for M. Ryan (with the rushing and receiving stats for their teams). I'm hoping this is an operator error that will be fixed shortly, but it reflects poorly on the product. (I apologize for the comments length, I'm hoping that the NFL is monitoring this feedback.)",

        "comment": "Out of a dozen attempts I made on my iPhone 4, I was able to get it to work three times. And even then it was frustratingly inconsistent in recognizing a pulse. I'm not sure what the indication is that it's reading your heart rate, as the \"dial\" moves around and then restarts constantly. Sometimes a blinking heart shows up. The instructions don't explain what the dial and heart icon are for. Keeping my finger in the same location would reveal a heart rate of 85... and then 31.\n\nWatched the video on their website to look at the location of my finger in comparison to theirs--same spot. It's possible that the technique they use to measure the heart rate doesn't work on everyone--thus the vast disparity in ratings for the app. Seems to work for some people and not for others.\n\nDoesn't work at all on my iPad 2 even in good lighting.",
