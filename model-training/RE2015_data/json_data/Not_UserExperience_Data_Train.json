Some kind of support for longer notes. Right now, single-tapping an item lets you edit the item. Maybe double-tapping should let you open an item's \"detail page\" where you could enter the due date, add an alarm, or type a longer note. \n4. Also, sharing a list? It would be great if my wife and I could add to or just see each other's shopping lists. Though now, I admit this is \"feature creep\" that could detract from Clear's simplicity.",
