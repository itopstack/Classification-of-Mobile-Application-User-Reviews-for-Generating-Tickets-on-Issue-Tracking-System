I have heard several reports about this glitch from other users.\n\nAdditionally, I am not happy with the choice of Facebook to change algorithms for vaccine critical posts. Before you let one side sway you, at least hear out our main concerns. Examples are Del Bigtree, Dr. Suzanne Humphries, Dr. Bob Sears, and Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, to name a few. Our side is asking for some action items that I think most people would be on board with:\n\n- Requiring pharmaceutical companies to conduct gold standard safety trials for FDA approval. This is what‚Äôs required for all other pharmaceuticals, and we are asking for the same rule to apply to vaccines.\n- Reversing the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act that removed liability from vaccine manufacturers. Reversing this act would allow one of the major drivers of continual improvement to be at play. We are talking about manufacturers who have all been charged with and successfully sued for fraud for other products. Merck currently is in court for the efficacy of the mumps component of its MMR vaccine, as well as for committing fraud during its HPV trials (two separate lawsuits).\n- HHS and NIH working together to review the data in their vast databases and compare the health outcomes of completely unvaccinated vs vaccinated (two cohorts of partial/delayed and fully vaccinated and on time). That way we can start to have more robust risk vs benefits profiles of each vaccine, or at least of vaccines in totality. If vaccines are incredibly safe and effective, this type of study would help relieve fears on all sides. If it shows that there are more risks than expected for vaccines, then it can help initiate studies to improve efficacy and safety of vaccines.\n- Subpoena whistleblower Dr. William Thompson from the CDC to speak in a public hearing before Congress and specifically address what happened during the 2004 MMR and autism study.\n\nThese are not preposterous thoughts or ideas. It is not dangerous to ask for better studied and safer medical interventions, especially those that are required for entrance to daycare or private/public schools and even some workplaces (FYI: all but three states in the US have religious and/or philosophical exemptions to opt out of some or all vaccines, or to vaccinate on a delayed schedule). It is not dangerous to ask for truly informed consent and better training of doctors and healthcare professionals of symptoms of vaccine adverse reactions. It is not dangerous to question established practice. What is dangerous is censorship.",
