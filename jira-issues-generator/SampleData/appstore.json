As I‚Äôve said before. It must be nice to get paid for doing nothing!!!Profile Page won‚Äôt load. Newsfeed won‚Äôt load. Can‚Äôt scroll down. \n\n03-01-19 - Well, you‚Äôve done it again idiots!   Just after today‚Äôs update, app. crashes/closes every few seconds. At least you‚Äôre consistent in your poor quality. \n\n2-4-19 - App. still crashes every few seconds. Stupid!! Guess you‚Äôre lucky. You get paid for doing nothing. \n2-1-19. Same Crap, Different Day!  You just can‚Äôt get it right. After yesterday‚Äôs update, app. still crashes every few seconds. \n\n1-28-19 Nothing but Negative Reviews. Hmmm. Do you think that might mean something????!!  App. Still crashes every few seconds. I‚Äôve only been reporting it since early November. Same Crap, Different Day!\n\n1-27-19. Well. Here We Go, YET AGAIN!   Your recent update causes the app. to constantly crash!!!  You‚Äôd think after all this time you could stop being lazy and sloppy and get it right before you push it out there!   How long will it take you to fix it this time?\n\n12-11 - Are you ever going to fix this crappy app.?!?!?!? Still crashes every few seconds. Keyboard doesn‚Äôt work when reposting!  You put out useless updates and never fix the problems. I mainly use this for important events. Can‚Äôt do that if app. won‚Äôt stay open. How much do you get paid for doing nothing?  \n\n12-8 - Sam Crap!  Different Day!!  App. still crashes every few seconds and keyboard doesn‚Äôt work when reposting articles with your own comment. BLAH, BLAH, BLAH!  Yatta, Yatta, Yatta!  Guess it was another lazy, overpaid day for all of you. \n\n12-7 - IPhone app.  getting worse and worse!  Closes/Crashes every 4 seconds. Keyboard still doesn‚Äôt work when reposting with your own comment. All other apps. work and keyboard works in all other cases, IT‚ÄôS YOU, NOT US!   You get caught compromising our information, post obnoxious ads. based on your trolling us, get paid way too much and do nothing.  You put out useless updates and don‚Äôt fix problems. Can‚Äôt read or update important events.  HELLO!!  ANYONE THERE????  WHAT DO YOU ACTUALLY DO?!?!??? \n12-6-18-Well, been complaining for almost a month now and absolutely NOTHING HAS IMPROVED!!!!!  App. crashes/closes every few seconds, YET AGAIN!!!   You put out useless updates that fix NOTHING. IT‚Äôs you. All other apps. work on my IPhone. Keyboard works for everything else, but not when reposting in Facebook!   You all are useless!  A waste of space!!!!!\n12-5- New Day - Same Crap!  App., ONCE AGAIN, closing every few seconds. Can‚Äôt check event calendar or post changes in events, etc....  HELLO!!! Anyone there know anything about anything????? Keyboard still not working when reposting articles and posting comments with them, etc. Keyboard working in all other cases; and all other apps. working on my IPhone.  Same ridiculous crap has been going on for months!!!   \n\n12-4- Keyboard still not working when typing in comments on articles you‚Äôre reposting. \n  \n11-29 -  Well. App. isn‚Äôt crashing. I give you that. However, the keyboard still doesn‚Äôt work correctly when typing a comment when reposting an article. My IPhone keyboard works correctly with all other apps. and when texting. So, again, it‚Äôs you, not us!!!  You made one correction, but left the other mistake behind. Guess it‚Äôs just too tough for you overpaid do nothings. \n\n11-26- Bugs still not fixed. Notifications disappear or reappear after clicking them. Keyboard is still totally screwed when trying to share a post and add your own comment. My keyboard works with everything else, so it‚Äôs not my phone. All my other apps. work properly. Profile page won‚Äôt load most of the time. Please don‚Äôt push out another useless update. That‚Äôs pointless. Could we get real fixes?????  How much do you guys make for doing nothing and compromising our information?????\n\n11-18 - OK SERIOUSLY!!!  Another useless, horribly crappy update today. Christ!!!!!  Can you do anything right at all?!?!?!?!  The stupid app. still closes/crashes every few seconds!!!!  When typing a comment, when reposting an article, the keyboard doesn‚Äôt work correctly. When pushing the space bar, the keyboard goes backward and erases instead of going forward.  WTAH????  It‚Äôs not my phone because all other apps. work and the keyboard works when texting and with all other apps?   You guys not only compromise our information and our country, (and knew about it and did nothing) you can‚Äôt get the smallest things right. You get paid how much and don‚Äôt know what the Hell You‚Äôre doing?\n\n11-15 - Seriously?!!  Now it‚Äôs closing every two seconds!!!\n\n11-15- Nothing yet done to fix your useless app.  Still crashes and closes every few seconds. HELLO!  Are there any competent people there????  (Crickets)\n\n11-13 -Your most recent update was useless because it rendered the app. unusable. App. still crashing/closing every few seconds. Can‚Äôt check events or respond to anyone. What‚Äôs the point of this app if it closes every few seconds?  Why hire people if they don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing?!? Any chance it might be fixed properly??\n\n11‚Äì12-18-Are you going to actually fix this problem.  App. constantly crashes and closes after recent update. You‚Äôve done this numerous times before. Updates useless if they make the app. unusable!!!\n\n11-09-18 - Well, you brilliant people have managed to do it again. After the update today, the app. constantly crashes. Only stays open for 3-5 seconds, then closes. Can‚Äôt check on event dates, etc....  This has happened with numerous updates. Why do you hire people who have no idea what they‚Äôre doing?!?!?
